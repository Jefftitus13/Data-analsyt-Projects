# Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization in R

# Project Summary: Data Cleaning on FIFA 19 Dataset using R
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data cleaning on the FIFA 19 dataset using the R programming language. The dataset, sourced from FIFA 19, contains detailed information about football players, including attributes such as height, weight, and various player statistics.

# Dataset Overview:
The FIFA 19 dataset includes a wide range of information about football players, including personal details, playing attributes, and performance statistics. However, the dataset may require cleaning and preprocessing to make it suitable for analysis and visualization.

# Data Cleaning Steps:
# Data Import and Inspection:
Load the FIFA 19 dataset into R.
Examine the structure of the dataset, check for missing values, and understand the variable types.

# Column Deletion:
Identify and remove irrelevant or redundant columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
Delete columns that contain a significant number of missing values.

# Column Concatenation:
Combine relevant columns to create new variables that enhance the dataset's usability.
For example, concatenate 'First Name' and 'Last Name' to create a 'Full Name' column.

# Unit Conversion:
Convert height from centimeters to feet for better readability.
Convert weight from kilograms to pounds for consistency and compatibility with other datasets.

# Data Validation:
Check for outliers and anomalies in numerical columns.
Validate converted units to ensure accuracy and consistency.

# Cleaning Outputs:
# Streamlined Dataset:
The dataset will be refined to include only essential columns, reducing redundancy and improving clarity.
Irrelevant information and columns with excessive missing values will be removed.

# Enhanced Variables:
New variables will be created through concatenation, providing more informative and concise data.

# Unit-Adjusted Metrics:
Height will be presented in feet, offering a more intuitive measure.
Weight will be standardized in pounds for consistency with common metrics.

# Tools Used:
1. R programming language
2. R libraries: dplyr, tidyr, etc.

# Conclusion:
This data cleaning project on the FIFA 19 dataset aims to transform the raw data into a cleaner, more manageable format. By removing unnecessary columns, concatenating relevant information, and adjusting units for height and weight, the dataset becomes more conducive to subsequent analyses and visualizations. The cleaned dataset will serve as a solid foundation for exploring player attributes and conducting further investigations into the world of football.

# Project Summary: Data Visualization with ggplot2 on mtcars Dataset

# Objective:
This project aims to visually explore the relationships and patterns within the mtcars dataset using the R programming language, specifically leveraging the ggplot2 package. The primary focus is on creating informative visualizations, including bar charts, scatterplots, and smoothed scatter plots, to gain insights into the dataset's key variables.

# Dataset Overview:
The mtcars dataset contains information on various automobile models, including attributes such as miles per gallon (mpg), number of gears, weight, and horsepower. The dataset serves as a rich source for understanding the relationships between these variables and exploring patterns within the automotive data.

# Visualization Steps:
# Bar Chart for Average MPG by Gear:
1. Create a bar chart to visualize the average miles per gallon (MPG) for each number of gears.
2. Utilize color or other aesthetics to enhance the visual representation of the data.

# Scatterplot for MPG against Weight:
1. Generate a scatterplot to explore the relationship between miles per gallon (MPG) and the weight of the cars.
2. Implement color or size coding to convey additional information if applicable.

# Scatter Plot with Smoothed Line for MPG and Horsepower:
1. Develop a scatter plot with a smoothed line (e.g., using a loess or linear regression) to investigate the relationship between miles per gallon (MPG) and horsepower.
2. Include confidence intervals to assess the reliability of the trend.

# Visualization Outputs:
# Average MPG by Gear:
Clear visualization depicting the average MPG for different gear configurations.
Insights into whether the number of gears correlates with fuel efficiency.

# MPG against Weight:
Scatterplot illustrating how miles per gallon varies concerning the weight of the cars.
Identification of any discernible patterns or trends.

# Scatter Plot with Smoothed Line (MPG and Horsepower):
Visual representation of the relationship between miles per gallon and horsepower.
Assessment of the trend and identification of potential outliers.

# Tools Used:
R programming language
ggplot2 package for data visualization

# Conclusion:
This data visualization project on the mtcars dataset provides a visual exploration of key automotive attributes. By leveraging bar charts, scatterplots, and smoothed scatter plots, the project aims to uncover insights into the relationships between variables such as MPG, gears, weight, and horsepower. The visualizations will contribute to a better understanding of the automotive dataset and serve as a foundation for further analysis.
